## Hello!

  I am a 19 year old aspiring programmer that likes creating new things.
My path to becoming a programmer started with when I was very young at 2 years old, where 
my family let me use a keyboard for fun. Of course, I was a baby so I didn't know what was happening 
but I thought it was really cool. Fast forward a few years and I was then introduced to video games 
by my brother and it fascinated me that things like that were able to be created.

  My main hobbies are playing video games, art, and programming. I have built up these skills just because I thought it would 
be fun, but I realized a while ago that these are skills that can allow me to be a solo game developer. I 
have aspirations to try out game development but I am still trying to build an idea of what I want to make 
while staying as an attainable goal.
